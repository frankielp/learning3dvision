# Learning in 3D Vision

This repository accompanies the **Learning in 3D Vision** course at Carnegie Mellon University and provides assignments to help you grasp the concepts of 3D vision and learning-based methods.

## Course Description

In the world of AI, understanding 3D representations is crucial for creating autonomous agents that interact effectively with their environment. This course explores the confluence of 3D Vision and Learning-based methods. Topics include:

- Explicit, Implicit, and Neural 3D Representations
- Differentiable Rendering
- Single-view 3D Prediction: Objects, Scenes, and Humans
- Neural Rendering
- Multi-view 3D Inference: Radiance Fields, Multi-plane Images, Implicit Surfaces, etc.
- Generative 3D Models, Shape Abstraction, Mesh and Point Cloud Processing

## Format and Prerequisites

This lecture-based course assesses your understanding through assignments and a final project. You need coding skills and basics in Computer Vision (image formation, ray optics) and Machine Learning (optimization, neural networks).
